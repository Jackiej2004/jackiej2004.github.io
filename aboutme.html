    My name is Jacqueline James but most people that really know me just call me Jackie. I really love to right stories and read as well and draw. I really love outer space and the stars. When I grow older I would like to become an astronomer or go into baby sitting. I really love to help out people and take care of children. My favorite song is I hope by gabby barrett and I really enjoy reading, writing and singing in my free time! I usually write fictional stories about almost anything I have in mind. I started writing stories in 6th grade with one of my old friends. They were my biggest inspiration to start writing. I like writing poems aswell but I dont write them as much as my stories because my poems are mainly just a way of expressing my emotions like a journal. I love to cook and go out in nature, I find the outdoors very relaxing and just nature in itself to be extremely beautiful.
